	aes-bf: AES Brute-force Toolkit
	===============================

This code is a flexible toolkit to brute force AES keys.

Features
--------
- Implements AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 encoding/decoding with AES-NI.

- Use threads to parallelize the search.

- Provide a list of basic functions to analyze the results


Basic usage of the tool is to provide it with one or several pairs of
plain/cipher text and a way to build the keys and it will search for all
matching keys by brute-forcing all the keys.
